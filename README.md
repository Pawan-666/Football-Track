## Original Project

This CLI tool is based on the [Football-Track GNOME Extension](https://github.com/AbhishekTimalsina/Football-Track) by AbhishekTimalsina. The original extension provides football tracking functionality for GNOME desktop environments, and this project adapts that functionality for command-line usage with an interactive vim-style interface.
